# Frontend Refactoring Issues (Figma Alignment)

Date: 2026-04-21
Context: Refactoring pass based on implemented frontend review versus current design direction.

## Confirmed Correctly Implemented

- Dark green plus gold visual direction is implemented and consistent with product identity.
- Sidebar navigation structure is implemented and functional.
- Trades screen contains required status filters: All, Active, Pending, Completed, Disputed.
- Trades screen includes the Create Trade primary action in the expected area.
- Empty-state handling exists when no trades are returned.
- Trade table and status chips are implemented for populated states.

## Flagged Gaps (Needs Refactor)

- Duplicate header and shell layers are rendered on Trades.
- Shell composition is inconsistent between Trades and Create Trade flows.
- Typography usage is inconsistent with design token intent.
- Root page remains template-like and not product-aligned.
- Spacing and container alignment rhythm is inconsistent across chrome and content.
- Navigation active and hover states are not fully unified.
- Surface and border token usage is mixed and not fully standardized.
- Empty state hierarchy and guidance can be improved.
